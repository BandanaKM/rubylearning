a. Imagine for a moment, that you want to be able to set a variable, but if it’s not set, you default to a known value. You’d rather do it on a single line.

puts expand = defined?( expand ) ? expand : true
Why is the output nil ?

=====

Because as the ruby parser does a first pass and have all variables in memory, it affect nil to them.

So after the first pass expand = nil
defined?(expand) returns true (well its return is evaluated as true at least) so 
expand = expand = nil
