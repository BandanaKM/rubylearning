b. What happens in the following Ruby code?
  
x = 10
y = 20
x, y = y, x
puts x
puts y

======

The result is that it exchange sequence values.
If you look into the returned class, it is an array.

(x, y = y, x).class
# Result: Array

The equal sign = method transforms y,x to [y,x] that's why we get the array class, Then it assigns values in elements array as subsequence to variables.

If you look the code below, x = [20, 10] which is an array class.

x = y, x
# Result: x = [20, 10]
